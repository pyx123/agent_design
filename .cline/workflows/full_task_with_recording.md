# Full Task with Recording Workflow

## Purpose
Execute a complete task with comprehensive recording of all interactions, tool calls, and performance metrics.

## When to Use
- For any significant development task
- When starting a new project or feature
- For tasks that require detailed tracking and analysis
- When working on complex multi-step operations

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Initialize Task Recording
Start by initializing the task recording:
```
[start_task_recording.md]
```

### 2. Execute Task with Recording
Throughout the task execution:

#### For Each LLM Interaction:
```
[record_interaction.md]
```

#### For Each Tool Call:
```
[record_tool_call.md]
```

#### For Performance Milestones:
```
[record_performance_metric.md]
```

### 3. Monitor Progress
Periodically check task analytics:
```
[get_task_analytics.md]
```

### 4. Complete Task Recording
Finalize the task recording:
```
[complete_task_recording.md]
```

## Example Complete Task Flow

### Step 1: Start Recording
```
I'm beginning a new task to create a user authentication system. Let me start recording.

[start_task_recording.md]
```

### Step 2: Plan and Design
```
Now I'll plan the authentication system architecture.

[record_interaction.md]
```

### Step 3: Generate Code
```
I'll create the authentication models and views.

[record_tool_call.md]
[record_interaction.md]
```

### Step 4: Test Implementation
```
Let me test the authentication system.

[record_tool_call.md]
[record_performance_metric.md]
```

### Step 5: Monitor Progress
```
Let me check how the task is progressing.

[get_task_analytics.md]
```

### Step 6: Complete Task
```
The authentication system is complete. Let me finalize the recording.

[complete_task_recording.md]
```

## Recording Checklist

### Task Initialization
- [ ] Generate unique task ID
- [ ] Start task recording with metadata
- [ ] Verify recording started successfully

### During Task Execution
- [ ] Record every LLM interaction
- [ ] Record every tool call (success and failure)
- [ ] Record performance metrics at milestones
- [ ] Monitor progress with analytics

### Task Completion
- [ ] Record final performance metrics
- [ ] Complete task recording with status
- [ ] Generate final analytics report
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Best Practices

### Recording Consistency
- Record interactions immediately after they occur
- Use consistent metadata formats
- Maintain sequential ordering
- Include comprehensive context

### Performance Tracking
- Record timing for all major operations
- Track resource usage and costs
- Monitor success/failure rates
- Identify optimization opportunities

### Quality Assurance
- Include quality assessments in metadata
- Record both successes and failures
- Document lessons learned
- Provide actionable insights

## Error Handling
- If recording fails, log the error but continue the task
- Include recording failures in task metadata
- Never block main task execution due to recording issues
- Provide fallback mechanisms for critical recording

## Example Usage
```
I need to create a complete web application with authentication. Let me execute this as a full recorded task.

[full_task_with_recording.md]
```

## Benefits of Full Recording
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every interaction and tool call is recorded
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed metrics for optimization
- **Debugging Support**: Comprehensive logs for troubleshooting
- **Learning Insights**: Patterns and best practices identification
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic tracking of success and failure
- **Cost Tracking**: Financial impact monitoring
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into task execution
